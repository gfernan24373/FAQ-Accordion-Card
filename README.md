## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This is the second challenge I made it, this challenge in particulary make me learn more about positioning and rendering elements in the window browser with CSS Sintax. And on the side of the javascript file, I'm discovered that JS cannot read CSS properties on the external files, therefore you need to reset the properties or in this case setting again in the JS files for the elements you will be working on. If you don't know what I'm talking about feel free to select some element in js and check his property like style.display or style.color.

### Continued development

Like I said in the last challenge, the goal to learn all this stuff is continuing learning and continuing implementing your ideas to be a good programmer. In terms of learning, the next step is to focus on the trending programming languages. So, for the next months my mint will be focus on the JS frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [The Flash of Unstyled Content when the browser display the website](https://dev.to/lyqht/what-the-fouc-is-happening-flash-of-unstyled-content-413j) - For some reason I found this content useful to understand something tha would happen to you and how to fixed.
- [Responsive images and positioning elements](https://codepen.io/graup/pen/EPjNwr) - This was a really good help to understand how positioning elements in the window browser even if they are overlap.
- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-get-all-custom-properties-on-a-page-in-javascript/) - If you want to select a propertie value on the external CSS file (other folder in your directory project) from a manipulated DOM variable, read this.
- [Continue learning about Flexbox (same link like the previous challenge)](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
